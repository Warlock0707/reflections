# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I want to work on the project on seperate machines. When I'm collabarating with other people on a project. As a safeguard in a event where I lose all my local files.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: If Git automatically pulls all the changes then it might be the case that the code breaks and/or doesn't even compile. Or if another person is working on the same repository locally if might interfere with his/her work.
