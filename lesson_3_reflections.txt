# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I want to work on the project on seperate machines. When I'm collabarating with other people on a project. As a safeguard in a event where I lose all my local files.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: If Git automatically pulls all the changes then it might be the case that the code breaks and/or doesn't even compile. Or if another person is working on the same repository locally if might interfere with his/her work.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: "Clone" makes a copy of a repository from GitHub to your local machine or it can clone from one location to another on your local machine. "Forks" makes a copy of an existing repository from a account to another account. Branches are used when you want your master version to remain intact and want to try out something, but not have the fear of breaking the working version. Branches are useful when two people are working on a feature at the same time.
