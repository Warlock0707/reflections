-> Branches are label

-> Deattached mode means that you were looking at a commit without a label.

-> 'remote branch' means that I did not create the branch. It was created by someone else.

-> When you into 'deattached HEAD' you can make a commit which would not only be unreachable but also won't pollute the master branch

-> "<<<<<" signs to indicate merge conflicts
	- HEAD is my code
	- master is the code that is in master right now
	- ||||| is the original version that both version modified. also know as "common ancestors"

-> Committing often is the best pratice when using Git and Github

-> GitHub has not working directory or staging area.

-> Initialize with a README if you're creating a new repository with no content in it. This way it will start out with a commit.

-> Forking a repo is just making a copy of it on your account.
