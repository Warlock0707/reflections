# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When I run the git command 'git init' it makes a hidden folder called '.git' where it tracks all the changes that I make to the file(s) in the directory.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area is the middle part of the process where a user can choose which file(s) he want to add to the repository.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: Since I can see the difference betweent the latest commit and the changes that have been made in the staging area I can compare the versions and see that I have made only one logical change.
